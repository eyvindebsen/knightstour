Commodore 64 basic version to solve the knights tour problem

Horsing around with the "Knight's tour" problem on the Commodore 64.

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard,
such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

There are numerous ways to solve this.

This is the Warnsdorf's rule algorithm, looking forward 1 move. It messes up sometimes, or maybe i made a bug :D

Anyway it says further:
"The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students.[3] Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 Ã— 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards."

So i wonder, how many of you made code for this, and hope you will share.



v0.3 Got the knight sprite to move smoothly at any speed.
v0.2 Speeded up the main algo, having actual chessboard handy.
